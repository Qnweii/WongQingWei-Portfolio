    <div>
      <h1 class="heading-5">Background</h1>
      <div class="text-block-2" style="line-height: 2;">Jurong Bird Park was an aviary and tourist attraction located in Jurong.<br> It opened in 1971 and closed in 2022. It will be reopened in Mandai Wildlife Reserve and renamed to Bird Paradise.<br> This Virtual Reality app brings the user around some of the popular recreated areas in Jurong Bird Park, allowing them to experience/re-experience it.  
        These areas are the Entrance arc, Ticketing Booth, Penguin Coast, Pools Amphitheatre, Parrot Paradise, Waterfall Aviary, and Lorry Loft. Each area will be designed and built similarly to the actual location. 
        <br>There will also be different interactive activities at each area except the Entrance and ticketing booth for users to be immersed in. 
        <br>Users get to earn points when successfully completing the activities. With these points, rewards like Singapore Zoo vouchers can be redeemed.

    <h1 class="heading-12">DESIGN RATIONALE</h1>

    <div class="div-block-4" style="line-height: 2;">When discussing whether to develop a theme on educational content, the Jurong Bird Park concept came to our mind. We realized it holds one of our childhood memories as many of us had been to Jurong Bird Park when we were young, and this is an opportunity to create something memorable to commemorate the former Jurong Bird Park which has been closed.
    </div>
    
    <div class="div-block-4" style="line-height: 2;">Therefore, to remember Jurong Bird Park’s legacy during the 52 years, we decided to create a game about some of the most popular spots in Jurong Bird Park with missions to accomplish. This would allow players to go back to their times there and perhaps even evoke memories of the park's establishment, while participating in the game.
        <br><br>The ideal approach to recreate this Jurong Bird Park experience is to use a virtual reality (VR) headset since players can roam around and experience being in the Jurong Bird Park once more, which allows them to get more immersed in the experience.
        <br>One of the most important components in effectively replicating this VR game at Jurong Bird Park is the environment the player is in. Our main goal is to make the players feel nostalgic, and for us to do that, the environment they are in must be able to tell the story of the old Jurong Bird Park.
        <br>However, due to the time constraints, we were unable to accurately recreate the Jurong Bird Park in its entirety; as a result, the art concept of this VR environment we will be following is the stylized low poly.
        <br><br>Low poly style is preferred because it can be modelled and texture-mapped more quickly, and yet the environment's aesthetic appeal will remain fresh and innovative. We will be focusing more on the environment's structure by using a variety of shapes and forms but united through similar textures so that putting the elements together will still create the environment as closely as the Jurong Bird Park, as it will be difficult to replicate the feeling precisely due to the approach of using low poly style to recreate the Jurong Bird Park.

    <h1 class="heading-12">GAME OVERVIEW</h1>
    <div class="div-block-4" style="line-height: 2;">There are five different activities the player has to complete at five areas. <br>Each area will have a board stand that will explain the respective activities to complete before proceeding to the next area.<br>

  <div class="container-4 w-container">
    <h1 class="heading-12">PLATFORM MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS</h1>
    <div class="div-block-4" style="line-height: 2;">A virtual reality (VR) headset and a Unity build of the game. It will be best if the player is using an Android-compatible desktop when downloading the Unity build of this game.<br>

    <h1 class="heading-12">SYNOPSIS</h1>
    <div class="div-block-4" style="line-height: 2;">Bird’s Eye View is a virtual reality experience which enables users to revisit the now closed Jurong Bird Park. The experience aims to bring an element of nostalgia to the user by recreating moments that they may have experienced at Jurong Bird Park.
        <br><br>The experience contains 5 different activities for users to interact with and experience, such as attending the Highflyer’s show at the Pools Amphitheatre and visiting the iconic Waterfall Aviary.
        <br><br>The experience allows the user to progress using a point system, each location would be linked with a task which they have to complete. Once the task is completed the user would earn points in which they are able to progress to the next location.
        <br><br>If the user's total points exceed 500, the user has the chance to receive a 50% discount on admission to any of the Singapore Wildlife Reserves' attractions, which are the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, and River Safari.
        <br><br>In order to advertise this promotion, we created a poster and put it on display at the ticket counter so that user can learn about it and have a more immersive experience at the Jurong Bird Park even though it is a VR game we created.
        <img src="images/JBP/promotion.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; transform: translateX(50%);"><br><br>
        We also developed a website which the user will be able to see their accumulated points as well as their profile information, gaming statistics, and screenshots from the VR game. Hence, the user can easily access their overall game information with the implementation of our website.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container-4 w-container">
    <h1 class="heading-12">MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE WEBSITE</h1>
    <div class="div-block-4" style="line-height: 2;">The website was developed for registered players who can view their user information and game statistics from the VR game. <br>This website is linked to Firebase where all the data were fetched from there. Some statistics that they can look at will be how many points they will need to reach the reward and the quickest time taken to accomplish all the activity.<br><br>
        As each player has their own unique personal game statistics that they may refer to, this website will enable users to analyse their own game progress and enable them to better engage with the game.<br><br>
        Players can view their own screenshots taken using the camera asset in the game, as well as those taken by other players, on a different page. They can choose the pictures they prefer and send them to anyone they want through email or WhatsApp. Having a page where they can share screenshots from the game with one another will also help to better connect with other players.<br><br>
        The website allows users to simply update their new username and email address if they want to change their username and email address. <br>
        If their current points reach 500, they will receive a pop-up message congratulating them and more reward information will be emailed to them in the coming days so they can be informed about the reward they will be receiving soon. <br><br>
        Overall, this website benefits players in keeping track of their gaming progress, allows them to view pictures taken during their time playing, and also help to promote our game to whomever they share the pictures with.<br><br>

        Players can teleport to different locations on this map, but they can only do so if the location is not locked. To finish the game, the player must complete each of the five areas on the map. When an activity is finished, they will need this map to move on to the next area.

    <h1 class="heading-12">LEVEL SETTINGS</h1>
    <div class="div-block-4" style="line-height: 2;">
        We have chosen to divide the playing areas into 5 separate levels. These levels are areas that were present in Jurong Bird Park. The design of these levels attempts to recreate a simplified version of the actual area in Jurong Bird Park. At each level, there is a different activity that must be finished before moving on to the next level.<br>
        <br>This is done so that we can keep players engaged in various activities so that they will not become easily bored, and a different playing area will be made available to them after each activity is finished, giving them a new location to explore while completing activities. Each area will have a unique type of bird, with the exception of the ticket booth area, which serves as the starting location.<br><br>
        Below are the 5 gameplay levels that we have created for each activity: <br><br>
        
        <hr>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>Ticket Booth</u></strong><br><br>
        This level is the starting area where the player must first create a new account or log in to an existing account on this level in order to begin the game. Since this level is the first one the player sees, it features an iconic entrance to greet them as the game begins.<br><br>

        <hr>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>Parrot Paradise</u></strong><br><br>
        This level’s main feature is the Scarlet Macaw parrot enclosure which is one of the many parrot enclosures in Parrot Paradise at Jurong Bird Park.
        Below image shows the collection of images of the Parrot Paradise in Jurong Bird Park which will be used as a reference while creating the level.<br>
        <img src="images/JBP/parrot paradise pureref.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;"><br><br>

        <strong>White boxing: </strong><br>         
        <img src="images/JBP/parrot paradise whitebox.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;"><br><br>
        Since the activity only uses the Scarlet Macaw Parrots, some of them will move around the cage. This also makes the parrots feel more life-like and more interesting to look at when doing the activity. There are also two other bird cages which shows the Grey Parrot and the Hyacinth Macaw. Because they are not the focus, the birds in those cages will be static. However, the user can still get to learn about/appreciate them.<br><br>
        <strong>Final Layout: </strong><br>
        <img src="images/JBP/parrot paradise.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;"><br><br><br>

        <hr>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>Waterfall Aviary</u></strong><br><br>
        This level features the iconic waterfall which plunges over a natural cliff that leaves a lasting impression to visitors who have visited Jurong Bird Park before. Since this level is mainly on the waterfall and trees around them, this area will not have much structure models built around it.<br>
        Below image shows the collection of images of the Waterfall Aviary in Jurong Bird Park which will be used as a reference while creating the level.<br>
        <img src="images/JBP/waterfall pureref.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;"><br><br>

        <strong>White boxing: </strong><br>       
        <img src="images/JBP/waterfall whitebox.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;"><br><br>
        In order to make good use of the available spaces, the activity for this area will require the player to explore the surrounding area by looking for hidden items and completing tasks on the peacocks that are strolling around. Additionally, this enables players, who have previously visited this area before, to have a sense of nostalgia while playing the game. Since this level leans more towards a natural woodland aesthetic, it will use stylized low poly to better replicate the environment.<br><br>

        <hr>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>Lory Loft</u></strong><br><br>
        This level features the famous Lory Loft where players will be able to get bird food and walk around the area to feed the different kinds of lorikeets that are in the area. Lory Loft is the world’s largest walk-in Lory flight aviary, housing free-flying colourful Lorikeets in a rainforest ambience.<br>
        Below is the reference used to design the whole Lory Loft area.<br>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>Pools Amphitheatre -The High Flyers Show-</u></strong><br><br>
        The Jurong Bird Park's amphitheatre is located on this level, where most of the bird shows were presented for spectator enjoyment. By volunteering, members of the audience can interact with the birds during the performance.<br>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>1. Major Points of Considerations for UX when Designing VR Game</u></strong><br>
        1. Ensuring all the UI buttons can be click using the VR controllers. <br>
        2. Adding more buttons with icon images on it so that player can understand more easily. <br>
        3. Choosing colours on models and icons that are not too bright too dark so that players are able to see clear. <br>
        4. Positioning of UI so that it will not block majority of user’s view. <br>
        5. Positioning of 3D map object and camera object so that it will not interfere user’s movement and views. <br><br>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>2. Research on Environment</u></strong><br>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>4. Hardware Considerations</u></strong><br>
        Having strong graphics cards and CPUs when a player downloads our game will be better because our Unity game is rather large.<br>
        1. Virtual Reality Headset (Samsung Odyssey, Oculus Quest etc) <br>
        2. NIVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or better <br>
        3. Windows 10/11 <br>

    <h1 class="heading-12">CONSIDERATIONS TO INCLUSIVE DESIGN</h1>
    <div class="div-block-4" style="line-height: 2;">
        The main group of individuals that we are concentrating more on our VR game will be the ones with language barriers, who are also closely related to people of different ethnicities and those who are not very technologically savvy.<br><br>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>1. Language Barriers among people with different ethnicities</u></strong><br>
        We chose to incorporate more icons into our game since they are a common visual language which effectively bridges language gaps. It will be preferable, compared to translation plug-ins, because it helps the player to identify quickly and easily what they need and want during the game. <br>
        Thus, utilizing icons will help a diverse range of individuals and improve visual interest and grab the player’s attention more easily. <br><br>
        Image below are all the icons used for the game:<br>
        <img src="images/JBP/icons.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55"><br><br><br>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>2. Mild vision impairments individuals who would rather listen to voice instructions than reading.</u></strong><br>
        There will be a speaker icon next to the text for each set of instructions that they are given on the board stand, and it will activate a voice and read the content aloud to them. <br>
        This benefits people with mild vision impairments or those who would rather listen to the information than read it. <br>
        Below image shows the speaker icon at the top right corner of the board stand. The vivid contrast blue colour is intended to help player notice the button clearly and understand what it does.<br>

    <h1 class="heading-12">GROUPS OF PEOPLE EXCLUDED BY OUR GAME</h1>
    <div class="div-block-4" style="line-height: 2;">
        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>1. Groups that have a visual disability</u></strong><br>
        The main purpose of our game was to do a small-scale recreation of Jurong Bird Park. Hence, the environment is a big part of our game. If the user has a visual disability, they aren’t able to fully enjoy/appreciate the experience.<br>
        Furthermore, the completion of the activities heavily relies on the visuals of the game. For example, the activity in Parrot Paradise, the user needs to be able to identify the position of the parrots to complete the activity. Hence, someone with a visual disability may not be able to complete the activities and move on to other locations. <br><br>

        <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>2. Groups without modern technology</u></strong><br>
        Our game is built for virtual reality. Therefore, a virtual reality headset is needed to play our game. If a user does not have a virtual reality headset, our game can’t be played.<br><br>
