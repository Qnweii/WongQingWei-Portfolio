      <h1 class="heading-4">OVERVIEW</h1> 
      <div>
        <h1 class="heading-5">Background</h1>
        <div class="text-block-2" style="line-height: 2;">It is a simple word-making puzzle game where the player must unscramble the provided letters to form the correct word. The game concept is inspired by the "Scrabble" board game and the topic for the words are mostly happy words in order to match the design concept in this game.<br><br>
          This word puzzle game aims to assist players in expanding their word knowledge as they will encounter new vocabulary, sharpening problem-solving abilities within the allotted time, and serving as a fun way to learn new words while also enjoying the game. Any age group can play this game, but the player must have a basic understanding of English.<br>

      <h1 class="heading-12">BRIEF SUMMARY OF APPLICATION FLOW</h1>
      <div class="div-block-4">First, before starting the game, new players must create an account. Additionally, input validations will be applied. Existing users do not need to re-register and may proceed to login using their email address.<br><br>
          After creating an account and logging in, players are sent to the main menu where they can access pages like the leader board, player profile, tutorial page, and so forth. There are a few things to keep in mind after the player starts the game: <br><br>
          Player is given only 60 seconds to complete as many words as possible, each correct word will score 3 points while each incorrect word will deduct 2 points from the player's total score. The timer will be shortened if the hint or skip buttons are used. The player will be shown their final results in comparison to, if they have any, their prior best performance result once the game ends. Once they have completed each round, data will be updated, allowing them to view the leader board and their personal profile. Player can also restart the game to beat their high score. <br>

    <div class="container-4 w-container">
      <h1 class="heading-12">DESIGN RATIONALE</h1>
      <div class="div-block-4">The design concept I am aiming for for this game will be cartoon vector art style since it will be appropriate for all age groups and also convey the pleasant feeling while playing the game. All the design assets are created from scratch where I mostly change the colours and shape so that the designs still remain consistent throughout the game. <br><br>
          Another reason is that the randomized words in the game, which are mainly positive words, will complement the designs I created as well. Aside from the designs, I am also looking for audio effects that are cheerful so that it will go well with the whole game.<br>

      <h1 class="heading-12">DATA MODELLING</h1>
      <div class="div-block-4">
        Once the player has created or logged into an account, Firebase will gather and store their personal data here. Their login, email address, and password will be saved here, and the player status enables me to monitor whether or not they are active in the game.
      </div>
      <img src="/images/UnscrambleTheWords/Data01.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55"><br><br><br>

      <div class="div-block-4">
        The game data will be saved under a different class name when the user has finished the game. It will be easier to recall the data with all the current game info stored here.<br>
        Data saved in the Player Stats such as the total number of mistyped words and total number of completed rounds can be used to calculate the average mistype words per round and inform the player about it.

      <div class="div-block-4">
        Highest score and completed words will be obtained after each round of game in order to update the leader board statistics in the game. If the score is less than the high score, it will not be updated, same goes for the highest words completed data.

      <div class="div-block-4">
        When I run the game and this message shows under the Unity console, the leader board data is displayed on the leader board page; but, if I run the game without this message appearing, the leader board data is not displayed. There are no other errors accompanying this message and the data stored in the Firebase remains there. It seems that the data retrieved from Firebase to Unity is quite slow. <br><br>
      </div>

      <div class="div-block-4">
        Hence, I researched online and managed to retrieve the data faster and without the above message appearing. Below image will show the solution.<br>
      </div>
      <img src="/images/UnscrambleTheWords/solve01.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55"><br><br>
      <div class="div-block-4">
        The above image is where I added the index with orderByChild, under the rules tab, since these are the statistics that were retrieved the slowest. Adding this “. indexOn” helps to solve the above bug and improve query performance on my side. Most importantly, the leader board data are now able to be retrieved and displayed in Unity faster.<br>
