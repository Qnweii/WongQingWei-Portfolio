        <h1 class="heading-5">Background</h1>
        <div class="text-block-2" style="line-height: 2;">This app takes you on a nostalgic and immersive experience of cooking Ang Ku Kueh with your grandmother with Augmented Reality.<br> Users will firstly have to scan the AR Marker that is placed on a post card.  
          The app will then go through the steps of making Ang Ku Kueh in which the user can follow along. The user can follow the steps by interacting with the different 3D models by clicking, pinching sliding, etc. 
          <br><br>This experience is further enhanced through the voice over of the grandmother, sound effects, simple animations and the interaction with the mini kitchen illustrated on the postcard. 
          <br>After the user is done making the Ang Ku Kueh, the user gets to share their favorite memory when eating Ang Ku Kueh. The user will also get to see responses inputted by others which is achieved with Firebase.

      <h1 class="heading-12">DESIGN RATIONALE</h1>

      <div class="div-block-4">The design rationale behind "雪英 ANG KU KUEH" is to evoke nostalgia where we aim to create the sense of longing for the past when users use our app. Our app design concept will be based on the vector art style as the meaning will be much easier to portray and illustrate. One example is the cover page of our app, where an old and new photograph will be displayed next to one another from the same perspective but with different meanings.<br>
        <img src="/images/AngKuKueh/RationalePic01.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%;"><br><br>
      </div>

      
      <div class="div-block-4">The older photo shows a little girl being showered with affection as her grandma feeds her homemade Ang Ku Kueh, but the grown-up girl in the new picture has switched places and is now returning the favor by serving her grandmother her own handmade Ang Ku Kueh. <br>This art concept was inspired by the “Then and Now” picture to show how time has changed and to bring out the nostalgic happiness from the user, hence, using illustrations will be the more reasonable option since it is easier to illustrate and better connect to all types of audience.
          <br><br>The design of the postcard was another aspect that was taken into consideration. We chose to design a foldable postcard that the user will need to open in order to access the features of the application. 
          <br>The reason behind this creation is to symbolize the user “unfolding” the story behind our memory of Ang Ku Kueh. Another reason we decided to make a foldable postcard was so that we could add more elements for the user to interact with through the AR app. We felt that it would be an immersive experience for the user to “cook” on this “mini kitchen” with the different appliances/equipment needed to make the Ang Ku Kueh.<br>
          <img src="/images/AngKuKueh/RationalePic02.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%;"><br><br>
      </div>


      <div class="div-block-4">We were also inspired by peranakan tiles which were popularized in colonial times. We decided to design a very simplified version of peranakan tiles for the background of the postcard to sneak in another element of Singaporean culture. It is also to give a nostalgic feeling to users as it was popular in older times of Singapore. <br><br>
          The color scheme that we will stick to throughout the app will be of the 70s vintage colors, in order to emphasize the passing down of the family traditions while also reflecting the happiness of making Ang Ku Kueh with the grandmother. Below image shows the color scheme that we referred to:<br>

    <div class="container-4 w-container">
      <h1 class="heading-12">GOALS & OBJECTIVES</h1>
      <div class="div-block-4">Our goal for this project is to be able to successfully connect with the user’s childhood; to evoke the memories from their childhood using a common memory that many Singaporean children share, our grandparents cooking for us. We hope to bring an element of nostalgia to the users while they are using the app by recreating the moment of them trying to cook with their grandmother/grandfather.<br>
          At the end of the experience, there would be a section in which the user would be able to share their favorite local childhood snacks.
          <br>We hope that this bonds the users indirectly and creates a community of people who share similar memories with local snacks.

      <h1 class="heading-12">SUPPORTING RESEARCH</h1>
      <div class="div-block-4">
          Since we wanted an audio sound effect of a grandma to tell the story of this Ang Ku Kueh from the user’s perspective, one of our grandmas, Jasmine's ah ma, made a special appearance where users will get to hear her voice when they are using this app.<br>
          <br>We also requested song recommendations from her, so we set one of her song recommendations to play in the background of our app. The audio effects in our app will make users feel nostalgic and take them back to the good old days. It also creates a more immersive experience where the user feels like they are cooking for their grandparents.<br><br>
          Her recommended song track (“Xiao Bai Chuan”) where we play it at the background of our app:
