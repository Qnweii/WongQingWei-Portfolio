              We have decided to allow customers to preview their food portions in AR before committing to a purchase. This also makes the portion size look less intimidating as they can get a good gauge of the portion.<br><br>

          <h1 class="heading-5" id="prjOneTitleColor"><u>1. AR Website</u></h1>
          <div class="div-block-4">
            Due to the client's concerns of customers being intimidated by the portion sizes, we came up with a solution which is to implement an AR website for customers to be able to view the dish in AR before committing to the dish and purchasing it. <br>
            By allowing customers to preview the dish in AR, they are able to gauge the size of the dish, as well as see how the dish would look like when served. <br>

            <img src="/images/MC_Capstone/AR01.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"><br><br>        

            In addition, the implementation of the AR Preview of the dish help promote the variety of the dishes that Monster Curry has to offer. As AR has not been widely implemented in the F&B industry, customers might be more inclined to view all the dishes in AR. <br> 
            This would expose the customers to new dishes available in the menu, thus promoting the variety of Monster Curry's menu.<br>

            We develop a 2D single player game to entertain customers while they are waiting for their food. The game was made with the intention of giving the kitchen staff more time to prepare the dishes in demand.<br>
            While the customers plays the game, it keeps them preoccupied, making the waiting time seem shorter and overall improves their dining experience.<br><br>

            Estimated Game Duration: 5-10 minutes

            The theme of the game is kitchen preparation. EN Group: Monster Curry, specializes in serving Japanese demi-glace curry. Hence, to fit their brand, the game is based on recreating a Japanese curry dish. <br> 
            The players play the role of the chef preparing the dish. This allows the player to feel involved and creates a sense of personalisation, making the game more engaging and interactive.<br><br>

            The game consists of 5 different cooking processes. <br>
            The first step would be <strong>Collection</strong>, followed by <strong>Frying</strong>, <strong>Boiling</strong>, <strong>Chopping</strong>, and lastly <strong>Plating</strong>. <br>

            <strong>*Note: The ingredients will be generated at random at the start, and it will determine the cooking processes throughout the game.  Players will experience a unique cooking process each time they replay the game.</strong><br><br>
          

            Players will be given 3 lives to complete the game, excluding the last step (plating), within the stipulated time. <br> Players can take their time to complete the last step. <br>

          <div class="div-block-4">
            Monster Curry offers a wide range of dishes for customers to choose from. This large variety may intimidate customers making them feel less keen to want to visit the store. <br>
            Thus, in order to counter this problem, we chose to implement a food randomizer website which will randomize any of the chef recommended menu items from selected category, so that customers can make quick food choices.<br><br> 
            
            The randomizer allows customers to choose from 6 different categories; desserts, drinks, curry rice, pasta, curry ramen and monster burgers.<br> 
            In addition, the randomizer would be able to filter the food items into different food categories such as vegetarian, seafood, chicken, pork and beef. This allows customers a more specific choice of randomization while also providing them an element of freedom in their choice.<br>

          <h1 class="heading-5" id="prjOneTitleColor"><u>1. Using Photogrammetry for AR Website</u></h1>
          <div class="div-block-4">
            One of the features we choose to do is an AR website that allows customers to see the life-size of the food dishes before placing their orders. We have two options to accomplish that: either we model the dishes manually or we utilize a 3D scanning photogrammetry tool to produce 3D models of the dishes.<br>
            It would be extremely tedious and time-consuming to physically model the dishes by ourselves, and they might not turn out to be an exact replica of the real food dishes, which would be detrimental to the client.<br><br>
            Therefore, using a 3D scanning photogrammetry software to produce 3D models of the dishes using /images taken from various angles will be the most obvious choice.<br><br>

          <h1 class="heading-5">Polycam</h1>
          <div class="div-block-4">
          
            After evaluating various photogrammetry applications, we conclude that Polycam is the best option because it is reasonably priced and simple to connect to the website using our phones.<br>

            We can also export the models in an appropriate file format, such as .obj and .fbx, from which we can import the models into Maya or Blender to make further improvements.<br>

            We used video capture on Polycam to capture the 9 dishes on an autonomous Lazy Susan rotating tray so that we do not have to move around constantly to shoot the dishes from different angles. We also took multiple shots of the dishes that generated poor 3D models.<br><br>

            <br><br>

            When we were first testing out, we took over 100 /images for 1 dish and it took an hour to produce the 3D model, which was extremely time-consuming and inefficient.<br>
            As a result, we decided to take around 75–80 shots for each dish. Each 3D model of the dishes took around 30 minutes to generate, and the end results were of high and in acceptable quality.<br>
            We took a total of 3 hours to capture all the dishes with around 75-80 /images per dish.<br>

            We remove unwanted rough edges after importing the models into Maya before conducting retopology and quad draw.<br>

            <img src="/images/MC_Capstone/PolyCamEdit02.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"><br><br>              
            The purpose of retopology is to make the mesh simpler because the imported models from Polycam are high poly, which means that the polygons count is high. We want the polygon counts to be as low as possible so that it helps to minimize lag time when the model is being viewed online.<br>
            Therefore, retopologizing will help lower the poly count and make the mesh look more structured. <br><br>

            After the retopology process, the mesh is more organized and the number of polygons is smaller. The following stage will involve using the quad draw technique to fill up any holes discovered on the low poly mesh.<br><br>
            
            The last step will be baking the high poly to low poly mesh, which results in an organized mesh with lesser polygons that is prepared for import into Unity.<br><br>

            After a rough prototype was developed and showcased to our client, the main feedback given was that the players had no sense of direction or what they were doing throughout the whole game. <br>
            Thus, we implemented a Map Progression system before each cooking process, to give players a sense of where the game is progressing and how many steps left before they get to the end of the game.<br>

            This Food Randomizer Website was initially an idea brought up during the brainstorming session, which happened to be liked by the client during our pitching and a green light for its development was given. This idea strived to support the push for a larger menu variety.<br><br>      

            With the low-fidelity, it showcased the main features of a scrolling randomization, informative page for the chosen food item, with a link to the official monster curry menu.<br>

          <div class="div-block-4">
            <h4 style="color: rgb(180, 0, 0);">Problem: Detection of the image tracker is challenging due to the large size of AR models</h4>
            After user testing, we discovered that many users had trouble scanning due to the large size of the AR models. In order to see the AR models clearly as a whole plate, they had to move their phones further away from the image tracker.<br><br>         
            
            <img src="/images/MC_Capstone/Prob1AR.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%;"><br><br>

            If they moved the phone farther away from the image tracker, it can cause the image tracker to lose detection. Because of this, users can get frustrated because the AR models keep disappearing from their phones and need to be rescanned repeatedly.<br><br>
            However, the AR models are intentionally made to be the life-size of the plates as the purpose is to enable users to understand the actual size of the plates before ordering.<br>

            <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 180, 0);">Improvement: Include a new feature that allows users to resize the AR models</h4>
            To avoid the need for constant phone movement in order to view the entire AR dish, we decided to add a new function that will allow users to resize the dish using their fingertips.<br><br>          
            In order to inform users of the difference between the ratio of the actual size compared to the one that they have scaled, we also put a notification text at the bottom.<br>
            The notification text shows the proportion of the actual size in relation to the scaled version. This also serves as a reminder to the user that the scaled version does not represent the dish's actual size.<br><br>

            <h4 style="color: rgb(180, 0, 0);">Problem: The users were unaware that they could rotate/scale the dish using their fingertips</h4>
            Users were unaware they could rotate/scale the dish to see different angles when we asked them to do so. Because of this, they got confused by the 'Reset dish' button, and they were curious about how it worked.<br><br>

            We decided to add an arrow indicator at the corner of the screen to inform users that they can rotate/scale the dish with their fingertips to view it from various perspectives.<br>
            We positioned it in the corner to prevent it from taking up too much space on the screen, which would block the view of the AR model.<br><br>

            <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 180, 0);">Improvement: Display a game progress map before the start of each level</h4>
            After thorough client feedback and user testing, we made the decision to add a game progress map before the start of each level so that players will know how many levels remain before the game is completed.<br><br> 
            This helps players to understand the different levels they will be completing and the general flow of the game, so as to avoid confusion and get them ready for the next level they will be playing.<br><br>
