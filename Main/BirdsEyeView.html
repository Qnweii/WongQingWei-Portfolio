        <div class="text-block-2" style="line-height: 2;">Jurong Bird Park was closed in 2022, and to remember Jurong Bird Park’s legacy during the last 52 years,
          we decided to create a game about some of the most popular spots in Jurong Bird Park with missions to accomplish. <br>
          This Virtual Reality (VR) game aims to bring an element of nostalgia to user by recreating moments that they have experienced at Jurong Bird Park, such as attending the Highflyer’s show at the Pools Amphitheatre and visiting the iconic Waterfall Aviary.<br>

      <h1 class="heading-12">MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE WEBSITE</h1>
      <div class="div-block-4">
        The website was developed for registered players who can view their user information and game statistics from the VR game. <br>
        This website is linked to Firebase where all the data were fetched from there. Some statistics that they can look at will be how many points they will need to reach the reward and the quickest time taken to accomplish all the activity.

        The website allows users to simply update their new username and email address if they want to change their username and email address. <br>
        If their current points reach 500, they will receive a pop-up message congratulating them and more reward information will be emailed to them in the coming days so they can be informed about the reward they will be receiving soon. <br><br>
        Overall, this website benefits players in keeping track of their gaming progress, allows them to view pictures taken during their time playing, and also help to promote our game to whomever they share the pictures with.<br>

          Players can teleport to different locations on this map, but they can only do so if the location is not locked. To finish the game, the player must complete each of the five areas on the map. When an activity is finished, they will need this map to move on to the next area.<br>

      <div class="div-block-4"><strong>2. Toggleable Camera Asset</strong><br>
          With this camera, users can snap pictures of the places they like during the game, and afterward, the image will render out on the film above the camera so users can view the picture they just took.

          We have chosen to divide the playing areas into 5 separate levels. The design of these levels attempts to recreate a simplified version of the actual area in Jurong Bird Park. At each level, there is a different activity that must be finished before moving on to the next level.<br>
          Below are the 5 gameplay levels that we have created for each activity: <br><br>
          
          <hr>

          <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>Ticket Booth</u></strong><br><br>
          This level is the starting area where the player must first create a new account or log in to an existing account on this level in order to begin the game. Since this level is the first one the player sees, it features an iconic entrance to greet them as the game begins.<br><br>

          <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>Parrot Paradise</u></strong><br><br>
          This level’s main feature is the Scarlet Macaw parrot enclosure which is one of the many parrot enclosures in Parrot Paradise at Jurong Bird Park.

          <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>Waterfall Aviary</u></strong><br><br>
          This level features the iconic waterfall which plunges over a natural cliff that leaves a lasting impression to visitors who have visited Jurong Bird Park before. Since this level is mainly on the waterfall and trees around them, this area will not have much structure models built around it.<br>
          Below image shows the collection of /images of the Waterfall Aviary in Jurong Bird Park which will be used as a reference while creating the level.<br>

          In order to make good use of the available spaces, the activity for this area will require the player to explore the surrounding area by looking for hidden items and completing tasks on the peacocks that are strolling around.<br><br>

          <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>Lory Loft</u></strong><br><br>
          This level features the famous Lory Loft where players will be able to get bird food and walk around the area to feed the different kinds of lorikeets that are in the area. Lory Loft is the world’s largest walk-in Lory flight aviary, housing free-flying colourful Lorikeets in a rainforest ambience.<br>

          Having strong graphics cards and CPUs when a player downloads our game will be better because our Unity game is rather large.<br>
          <ol>
            <li>Virtual Reality Headset (Samsung Odyssey, Oculus Quest etc)</li>
            <li>NIVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or better</li>
            <li>Windows 10/11</li>

      <h1 class="heading-12">CONSIDERATIONS TO INCLUSIVE DESIGN</h1>
      <div class="div-block-4">
          The main group of individuals that we are concentrating more on our VR game will be the ones with language barriers, who are also closely related to people of different ethnicities and those who are not very technologically savvy.<br><br>

          <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>1. Language Barriers among people with different ethnicities</u></strong><br>
          We chose to incorporate more icons into our game since they are a common visual language which effectively bridges language gaps. It will be preferable, compared to translation plug-ins, because it helps the player to identify quickly and easily what they need and want during the game. <br>
          Thus, utilizing icons will help a diverse range of individuals and improve visual interest and grab the player’s attention more easily. <br><br>
          Image below are all the icons used for the game:<br>
          <img src="/images/JBP/icons.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55"><br><br><br>

          <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>2. Mild vision impairments individuals who would rather listen to voice instructions than reading.</u></strong><br>
          There will be a speaker icon next to the text for each set of instructions that they are given on the board stand, and it will activate a voice and read the content aloud to them. <br>
          This benefits people with mild vision impairments or those who would rather listen to the information than read it. <br>
          Below image shows the speaker icon at the top right corner of the board stand. The vivid contrast blue colour is intended to help player notice the button clearly and understand what it does.<br>

      <h1 class="heading-12">GROUPS OF PEOPLE EXCLUDED BY OUR GAME</h1>
      <div class="div-block-4">
          <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>1. Groups that have a visual disability</u></strong><br>
          The main purpose of our game was to do a small-scale recreation of Jurong Bird Park. Hence, the environment is a big part of our game. If the user has a visual disability, they aren’t able to fully enjoy/appreciate the experience.<br>
          Furthermore, the completion of the activities heavily relies on the visuals of the game. For example, the activity in Parrot Paradise, the user needs to be able to identify the position of the parrots to complete the activity. Hence, someone with a visual disability may not be able to complete the activities and move on to other locations. <br><br>

          <strong style="font-size: 17px;"><u>2. Groups without modern technology</u></strong><br>
          Our game is built for virtual reality. Therefore, a virtual reality headset is needed to play our game. If a user does not have a virtual reality headset, our game can’t be played.<br><br>
