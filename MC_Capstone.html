          After a comprehensive review of customer’s feedback, our team has decided to tackle the concerns of <strong>Variety vs Efficiency</strong> and <strong>Portion Sizes</strong>, seeking to provide an enhanced and unique dining experience for our client’s patrons.<br><br>
                   
          <strong><u>- Variety vs Efficiency</u></strong> <br> Balancing innovation and customer desires against operational feasibility. <br><br>

      <div class="div-block-3">
        <h1 class="heading-5">3 Key Features</h1>

        <div class="text-block-2" style="line-height: 2;"><strong><u>1. Enhancing the Customer Dining Experience with Augmented Reality (AR) Preview Website</u></strong><br>
          Our client has requested the incorporation of an AR experience in the customer dining journey to create an engaging and appetizing experience.<br>
          We have decided to allow customers to preview their food portions in AR before committing to a purchase. This also makes the portion size look less intimidating as they can get a good gauge of the portion.<br>
        
          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br>

          <div style="padding-top: 80px;"></div>
        

          <strong><u>2. Provide Entertainment through games while waiting for food. (2D Online Mobile Game: Remake the Curry!)</u></strong> <br>
          In consideration of our client’s manpower concern, we have proposed the integration of exciting games aiming to entertain and immerse the customers during the lengthy wait time. <br>
          Overcoming boredom and restlessness, especially during peak hours. This is a mobile game where players can easily play through a website. <br>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>  

          <strong>Scan this QR Code to access the game!</strong><i> (Supports smartphones devices only)</i>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br>

          <div style="padding-top: 80px;"></div>



          <strong><u>3. Improving the Food Selection Process with a Food Picker (Randomiser Website)</u></strong> <br>
          To reduce the burden of selecting from a large catalog of food choices, we proposed implementing a random food picker feature. <br>
          This feature will help customers select their meals quickly and may also provide an exciting and playful way to choose meals. By simplifying choices, it avoids the phenomenon of choice overload and has the potential to increase customer satisfaction.<br>

    <div class="container-4 w-container">
      <h1 class="heading-12" style="margin-left: 55px;">DETAILS OF THE 3 KEY FEATURES</h1>
      
      <!--Key feature: AR Web-->
      <div class="div-block-4">
        <h1 class="heading-5"><u>1. AR Website</u></h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
          Due to the client's concerns of customers being intimidated by the portion sizes, we came up with a solution which is to implement an AR website for customers to be able to view the dish in AR before committing to the dish and purchasing it. <br>
          By allowing customers to preview the dish in AR, they are able to gauge the size of the dish, as well as see how the dish would look like when served. <br><br>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>        

          In addition, the implementation of the AR Preview of the dish help promote the variety of the dishes that Monster Curry has to offer. As AR has not been widely implemented in the F&B industry, customers might be more inclined to view all the dishes in AR. <br> 
          This would expose the customers to new dishes available in the menu, thus promoting the variety of Monster Curry's menu.<br><br>
        </div>

        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;">User Journey Map for AR Website (How does it work)</h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
          We implemented <strong>Image Tracking in WebAR</strong>, which means users will be able to open up the website from their mobile devices, scan the image tracker, and the AR models will then show on the screen.<br>

      <!--Key feature: 2D Game-->
      <div class="div-block-4">
        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;"><u>2. Online Mobile 2D Game (Remake The Curry!)</u></h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
          We develop a 2D single player game to entertain customers while they are waiting for their food. The game was made with the intention of giving the kitchen staff more time to prepare the dishes in demand.<br>
          While the customers plays the game, it keeps them preoccupied, making the waiting time seem shorter and overall improves their dining experience.<br><br>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>        

          The theme of the game is kitchen preparation. Monster Curry, our client, specializes inserving Japanese demi-glace curry. Hence, to fit their brand, the game is based on recreating a Japanese curry dish. The players play the role of the chef preparing the dish. <br> 
          This allows the player to feel involved and creates a sense of personalisation, making the game more engaging and interactive.<br><br>
        </div>

        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;">User Journey Map for 2D Game (How does it work)</h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
          We used <strong>Unity WebGL</strong> to develop the game, which means players will be able to launch the game by scanning the QR code from their mobile devices. It supports both Android and IOS devices.<br>
        </div>

        </div>

        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;">How The Game Works</h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
          The game consists of 5 different steps. The first step would be <strong>Collection</strong>, followed by <strong>Frying</strong>, <strong>Boiling</strong>, <strong>Chopping</strong>, and lastly <strong>Plating</strong>. <br>
          Players would be given 3 lives to complete all 4 cooking steps, excluding the last step (plating), within the stipulated time. <br> But, they can take their time to complete the last step. <br><br>
          
          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>   
          
          The game can be accessed by scanning a QR code which will lead the player to the game's website. This QR Code can be integrated into Monster Curry's physical menu or into a poster, depending on what the client want.<br>
          We have designed a poster for this 2D Game, as part of our project submission. <br><br>

      <!--Key feature: Randomizer Web-->
      <div class="div-block-4">
        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;"><u>3. Food Randomizer Website</u></h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
          Monster Curry offers a wide range of dishes for customers to choose from. This large variety may intimidate customers making them feel less keen to want to visit the store. <br>
          Thus, in order to counter this problem, we chose to implement a food randomizer website which will randomize any of the chef recommended menu items from selected category, so that customers can make quick food choices.<br><br> 
          
          The randomizer allows customers to choose from 6 different categories; desserts, drinks, curry rice, pasta, curry ramen and monster burgers.<br> 
          In addition, the randomizer would be able to filter the food items into different food categories such as vegetarian, seafood, chicken, pork and beef. This allows customers a more specific choice of randomization while also providing them an element of freedom in their choice.<br><br>

    <div class="container-4 w-container">
      <h1 class="heading-12" style="margin-left: 55px;">KEY PROCESSES INVOLVED</h1>

      <!--Photogrammetry AR Web-->
      <div class="div-block-4">
        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;"><u>1. Using Photogrammetry for <span>AR Website</span></u></h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
          One of the features we choose to do is an AR website that allows customers to see the life-size of the food dishes before placing their orders. We have two options to accomplish that: either we model the dishes manually or we utilize a 3D scanning photogrammetry tool to produce 3D models of the dishes.<br>
          It would be extremely tedious and time-consuming to physically model the dishes by ourselves, and they might not turn out to be an exact replica of the real food dishes, which would be detrimental to the client.<br><br>
          Therefore, using a 3D scanning photogrammetry software to produce 3D models of the dishes using images taken from various angles will be the most obvious choice.<br><br>
        </div>

        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;">Polycam</h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
        
          After evaluating various photogrammetry applications, we conclude that Polycam is the best option because it is reasonably priced and simple to connect to the website using our phones.<br>
          We can also export the models in an appropriate file format, such as .obj and .fbx, from which we can import the models into Maya or Blender to make further improvements.<br>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>
        
        </div>

        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;">Photoshoot Meeting</h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
        
          We arranged a meeting with the client at one of the Monster Curry outlets for the photoshoot of all the featured dishes.<br>
          We used video capture on Polycam to capture the 9 dishes on an autonomous Lazy Susan rotating tray so that we do not have to move around constantly to shoot the dishes from different angles. We also took multiple shots of the dishes that generated poor 3D models.<br><br>
          
          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>

          When we were first testing out, we took over 100 images for 1 dish and it took an hour to produce the 3D model, which was extremely time-consuming and inefficient.<br>
          As a result, we decided to take around 75–80 shots for each dish. Each 3D model of the dishes took around 30 minutes to generate, and the end results were of high and in acceptable quality.<br>
          We took a total of 3 hours to capture all the dishes with around 75-80 images per dish.<br><br>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>        
        </div>


        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;">Editing Process - Understanding Retopology and Quad Draw Techniques -</h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>        
          We remove unwanted rough edges after importing the models into Maya before conducting retopology and quad draw.<br>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>              
          The purpose of retopology is to make the mesh simpler because the imported models from Polycam are high poly, which means that the polygons count is high. We want the polygon counts to be as low as possible so that it helps to minimize lag time when the model is being viewed online.<br>
          Therefore, retopologizing will help lower the poly count and make the mesh look more structured. <br><br>

          After the retopology process, the mesh is more organized and the number of polygons is smaller. The following stage will involve using the quad draw technique to fill up any holes discovered on the low poly mesh.<br><br>
          
          The last step will be baking the high poly to low poly mesh, which results in an organized mesh with lesser polygons that is prepared for import into Unity.<br>

      <div class="div-block-4">
        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;"><u>2. Ideation Phase for <span>2D Game</span></u></h1>
        <div class="div-block-4">
          After analyzing EN-Group's campaigns, we gathered some key traits we aim to achieve in our game: Uniqueness, Fun and Memorable, Replayable. The ideation phase started with the goal of a Unity web game built for both Android and iOS devices.<br>
          We looked at many different ideas, entertaining the possibility that this game, an idea we proposed, may not need to be in AR, or else it may complicate the nature of the game.<br><br> 
          Mind map during our ideation phase.<br><br>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br> 

          Different ideation phases planned out.<br><br> 
          
          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>        
          
          After multiple discussion sessions with our clients during our ideation phases, we have planned out a basic game flow that was acknowledged by the client and was given a green light for development.<br><br>
         
          <h4>Basic Game Flow</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Introduce</strong> the Ingredients for Cooking (Ingredients randomized at the start of the game)</li>
            <li><strong>Collect</strong> the Ingredients</li>
            <li><strong>Food Preparations</strong> (Any 3 steps from the 3 cooking methods (Chop, Fry, Boil))</li>
            <li><strong>Plate</strong> and Decorate the dish with the cooked ingredients</li>
          </ol>

          <br>

          <h4>Game Structure Map</h4>
          We also planned out a rough game system to understand how should the game progress after each cooking steps. <br>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br> 
          
          We begin the development by shortlisting the ingredients to be featured in the game. With a criteria of the ingredients being related to the curry dishes in Monster Curry only. <br><br>
          Below shows the table of ingredients we have implemented and its cooking process.<br>

          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>  

          <br>

          <h4>Importance of Game Progression Map</h4>
          After a rough prototype was developed and showcased to our client, the main feedback given was that the players had no sense of direction or what they were doing throughout the whole game. <br>
          Thus, we implemented a Map Progression system for the player to visualize where in terms of progress, they were at, and how many steps before they get to the end of the game.<br><br>

          Before each cooking stage, this progression map will show up to give players a sense of where the game is progressing.<br>

          This Food Randomizer Website was initially an idea brought up during the brainstorming session, which happened to be liked by the client during our pitching and a green light for its development was given. This idea strived to support the push for a larger menu variety.<br><br>
          
          With clean user design and simple interface in mind, we drew up a few prototypes from low to mid-fidelity before programming the site.<br>
          With the low-fidelity, it showcased the main features of a scrolling randomization, informative page for the chosen food item, with a link to the official monster curry menu.<br>

          However, after some discussion with the client, they wished to remove the menu link feature. Asking for the addition of food category filters, we started work on the mid-fidelity.<br>

          When the first sync for the high-fidelity website is done for showcase to the client during the meeting session on mid-July, the clients raised a concern over the brand colors. Thus, we moved to choose a palette that works with the site.<br>

          This is the finalized version of the Food Randomizer website prototype.<br>

          We completed user testing with multiple users for the AR website. However, we will only be recording a few participants because the others do not feel comfortable being recorded. Nevertheless, we have documented all their suggestions and implemented changes.<br><br>

        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;">User Testing Improvements</h1>

        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;"><u>Problem 1</u></h1>
        <!--Problem UT-->
        <div class="div-block-4">
          <h4 style="color: rgb(180, 0, 0);">Problem: Detection of the image tracker is challenging due to the large size of AR models</h4>
          After user testing, we discovered that many users had trouble scanning due to the large size of the AR models. In order to see the AR models clearly as a whole plate, they had to move their phones further away from the image tracker.<br>           
          
          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>

          If they moved the phone farther away from the image tracker, it can cause the image tracker to lose detection. Because of this, users can get frustrated because the AR models keep disappearing from their phones and need to be rescanned repeatedly.<br><br>
          However, the AR models are intentionally made to be the life-size of the plates as the purpose is to enable users to understand the actual size of the plates before ordering.<br>

        <!--Improvement UT-->
        <div class="div-block-4">
          <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 180, 0);">Improvement: Include a new feature that allows users to resize the AR models</h4>
          To avoid the need for constant phone movement in order to view the entire AR dish, we decided to add a new function that will allow users to resize the dish using their fingertips.<br><br>          
          In order to inform users of the difference between the ratio of the actual size compared to the one that they have scaled, we also put a notification text at the bottom.<br>
          The notification text shows the proportion of the actual size in relation to the scaled version. This also serves as a reminder to the user that the scaled version does not represent the dish's actual size.<br>

        </div>


        <h1 class="heading-5" style="white-space: nowrap;"><u>Problem 2</u></h1>
        <!--Problem UT-->
        <div class="div-block-4">
          <h4 style="color: rgb(180, 0, 0);">Problem: The users were unaware that they could rotate/scale the dish using their fingertips</h4>
          Users were unaware they could rotate/scale the dish to see different angles when we asked them to do so. Because of this, they got confused by the 'Reset dish' button, and they were curious about how it worked.<br>           
          
          <img src="images/" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-55" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; transform: translateX(20%);"><br><br>

          Therefore, we have to make the instructions more straightforward and ensure that they are aware of the dishes being able to rotate/scale.<br>

          <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 180, 0);">Improvement: Include arrows (UI) on the screen to indicate that the dish can be rotated/scaled</h4>
          We decided to add an arrow indicator at the corner of the screen to inform users that they can rotate/scale the dish with their fingertips to view it from various perspectives.<br>
          We positioned it in the corner to prevent it from taking up too much space on the screen, which would block the view of the AR model.<br><br>
